# CSE-352-Final-Project
Rock Bottom, a group of three teams up to create a final project for a Artificial Intelligence class. The plan is the create an application that accepts input of times when people are busy and outputs blocks of times where everyone is free/available.

Installation:
1) Under the "Code" button in the github respository, press Download ZIP. You should have been able to download a CSE-352-Final-Project-main.zip file.
2) Unzipping the package somewhere in your local repository will give you access to the files in the repository

Files of interest for usage: index.html
Files of interest for back-end: scripts.js
Files of interest for testing: Example 1.json, Example 2.json, Example 3.json, Example 4.json

Instructions:
1) Open the index.html file in your browser, any browser should work here.
2) Drag the example json's in to the "Choose File" section or click the Choose File button to select one of the given json files.
3) If the json file is valid, you should immediately receive an output on the shifts and the associated person (currently represented as a number in this version of the code) assigned to the shift.
4) You can choose to create custom json files based on the template provided in both the html file and the report (if you have that) to try out the code. Understand however that the shifts are currently hard coded for this version of the codebase and that the available time slots for a person should adhere to the times available.
